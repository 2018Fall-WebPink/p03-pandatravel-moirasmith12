        <h4>Travel to West Virginia State Penitentiary</h4>
        <p>What started as an old prison in 1866 and continued to hold inmates till 1995, is now a popular tourist spot for those who dare to enter. In this penitentiary, 94 men have suffered the death penalty. Of the 94 men, 85 were killed by hanging, and 9 were killed through the electric chair. In 1965, the death penalty was abolished in 1965. Many people have said they have experienced paranormal activity there, probably due to the numerous gruesome deaths on the property.</p>
